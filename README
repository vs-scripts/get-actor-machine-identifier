1.  Introduction

   This document describes the get-actor-machine-identifier library and
   its usage in Node.js and in modern browsers.

2.  Installation

   npm install get-actor-machine-identifier

3.  Usage

   3.1.  Node.js

      import { generateActorMachineIdentifier } from 
         'get-actor-machine-identifier';

      const identifier = await generateActorMachineIdentifier();

   3.2.  Browser

      import { generateActorMachineIdentifier } from
         './get-actor-machine-identifier.js';

      const identifier = await generateActorMachineIdentifier();

4.  Output Format

   The library generates an identifier in a 3-6-9 base36 format:

   xxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx

   The identifier consists of three segments:

   o  3 characters: Random component
   o  6 characters: Machine-based component (derived from a platform-
      specific machine identifier)
   o  9 characters: GUID-based component (derived from a generated UUID)

   The segments are randomly shuffled, so the order may vary between
   calls.  The format is intended to ensure uniqueness while maintaining
   privacy.

5.  How It Works

   The library uses platform-specific methods to obtain a machine input:

   o  Windows: Reads MachineGuid from the Windows Registry at
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography

   o  Linux: Reads machine ID from /etc/machine-id

   o  macOS: Retrieves platform UUID using the ioreg command

   o  Browser: Generates a fingerprint based on navigator properties,
      screen dimensions, language, and timezone

   The machine input is hashed using SHA-256 and converted to base36.
   A random component and a UUID-based component are added, and the
   three segments are shuffled.

6.  Requirements

   o  Node.js: 24.12.0
   o  npm: 10.5.0
   o  Browser: Modern browser with Web Crypto API support
   o  Module system: ESM modules only

7.  Testing

   This repository is intended to be tested with Node.js v24.12.0.

   To avoid changing your global Node installation, you can put a
   portable Node distribution under:

   o  tests/tools/node/win32-x64/node.exe (Windows)
   o  tests/tools/node/linux-x64/bin/node (Linux)
   o  tests/tools/node/darwin-arm64/bin/node (macOS Apple Silicon)
   o  tests/tools/node/darwin-x64/bin/node (macOS Intel)

   Then activate it for the current terminal session:

   Windows (PowerShell / pwsh):

      .\tests\scripts\use-node.ps1

   macOS/Linux (bash/zsh):

      . ./tests/scripts/use-node.sh

   Run the test suite with:

      npm test

   The test suite includes unit tests, integration tests, and coverage
   reporting with nyc (80% minimum coverage required).

8.  Security Considerations

   This library derives part of the identifier from machine and
   environment specific inputs.  Implementers should consider the
   privacy implications of generating stable identifiers and ensure the
   identifier is not used as an authentication factor.
